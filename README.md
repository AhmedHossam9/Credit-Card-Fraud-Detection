Credit card fraud is a pervasive and costly issue affecting individuals, businesses, and financial institutions worldwide. We used deep learning to classify if it’s a fraud or not and the models we used are CNN and FNN. The dataset we used consists of a total of 284,807 transactions. Out of these transactions, there are 492 cases of fraud. Hence, the dataset is highly unbalanced, with the fraudulent transactions representing only 0.172% of the total transactions. So we did balance it by applying undersampler for the dominant class and oversampler for the rare class. The Methods we used were CNN – FNN and the CNN preformed better with average accuracy 0.999 and FNN with 0.995 also CNN with less losses.
